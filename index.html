            <h3> <span class="scolor"> Front-End</span> Web Developer</h3>
            <p> Learning web development is fun and teaching the same is more exciting. I'm a Computer Science major student, soon going to complete my graduation. Other than web development, specially front end, I am a Teaching Assistant (TA) in IUB along with Research Assistant (RA) at the same place. I do believe with concentration, hard work, dedication and practice, even the hardest work can be done.</p>

            <h3>Become a <span class="scolor2">Full-Stack Web Developer</span></h3>
            <p> Currently been mastered the basics of HTML and CSS, creating a website using these are matter of seconds. Although, my ultimate goal is to master both the frontend side and then of course the backend web development as well. I do believe that a fullstack web developer is capable of designing the perfect website both from the client end and the server end. In Sha Allah my dream to become a fullstack web developer is soon to be accomplished.</p>
